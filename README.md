A simple package to manage flows in your Laravel application.
This package aims to provider a "ticketing" system to manage the flow of a certain Model

So lets say you have orders, but a order can be retried many times, but you want to know exactly
what happened on that "flow" of the order, so you can use this package to manage that
The flow also aims to store some additional context if requires, so you can store the request payload, the response payload, the error message, etc


## Installation

```bash
composer require flavorly/laravel-flows

php artisan vendor:publish --tag="flows-config"
